## Troubleshooting

### TensorFlow Installation Issues

- **Issue: TensorFlow 2.10.0 installation fails**
  - **Requirement**: Ensure you are using Python 3.10. TensorFlow 2.10.0 is compatible with Python 3.10.
  - **Update pip**: Make sure `pip` is up-to-date. You can update it using:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
  - **Install Wheel File**:
    1. Download the appropriate wheel file for TensorFlow 2.10.0 from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/2.10.0/#files). Look for the file that matches your system architecture (e.g., `tensorflow-2.10.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl` for Windows 64-bit).
    2. Install the wheel file using:
       ```bash
       pip install path_to_downloaded_wheel_file.whl
       ```
    Replace `path_to_downloaded_wheel_file.whl` with the actual path to the downloaded file.

  - **Check Compatibility**: Ensure that the installed TensorFlow version is compatible with your Python version and operating system.

- **Issue: Compatibility errors**
  - Verify that your Python version matches the required version for TensorFlow 2.10.0 (Python 3.10).
  - If you continue to face issues, consider trying a different version of TensorFlow. Update the `requirements.txt` file with a compatible version if needed.
  - For detailed installation and troubleshooting information, visit TensorFlow’s [official installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

- **Additional Tips**:
  - **Use a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. Create and activate a virtual environment using:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the environment
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    ```
  - **Docker**: Consider using a Docker container with TensorFlow pre-installed if you encounter persistent issues. TensorFlow provides Docker images for various configurations.
